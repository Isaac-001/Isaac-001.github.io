	<p class="sansserif"><center><big><big> Today I learned how to create a CSS stylesheet. There are still a little bit of problems with it, but They'll be straightened out soon enough.

		Update: I've fixed the issue just like I said I would. Im getting a little better at problem solving thanks to coding.

		<p class="sansserif"><center><big><big> Today I learned how to write JavaScript. It's not my favorite language to write in because of how complicated it gets for me. Sometimes it’s simple and easy like when I was writing the code so that the time and date will pop up when a screen is opened. Other times it’s hard like when I was trying to code the button so that a sentence would change whenever it was clicked. My computer stopped me from loading my old progress so I had to start again from an earlier checkpoint. It was fun however, when the buttons actually worked and our funny messages would appear. More and more has been added to my website and I would say it's growing steadily. I just think it needs a little bit more organization.</p></big></big></center>
