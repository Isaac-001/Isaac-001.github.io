<p><big><big>I've learned to do a lot of things with buttons, but I still have so much to learn. It's been fun making this website and it's given me a lot of experience in the areas I needed. This website has been more of an experiment for me. I still need to work on my orginizational skills and placement. Leave feedback on what I can improve on and what I can add.
